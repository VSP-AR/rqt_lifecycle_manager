# RQT ROS 2 Lifecycle Manager Plugin

Simple RQT plugin to manage the lifecycle of ROS 2 nodes.

Currently, has minimal functionality to `configure`, `activate`, `deactivate`, `cleanup` and `shutdown` nodes.

### Todo
- [ ] Improve UI
- [ ] More lifecycle states and transitions support
- [ ] Fix trasitioning issues in UI display.
